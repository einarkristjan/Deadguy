A prototype made for the [Icelandic Gaming Industry](http://igi.is/) Game Creator Competition in 2011. The project won "Best Art Direction".

First written in [Processing](https://processing.org/) and then ported to HTML5 Canvas / Javascript ES5 with [Box2dWeb](http://buildnewgames.com/box2dweb/) for physics. Now updated to ES6 using [PixiJS](http://www.pixijs.com/) for rendering and [box2d.js](https://github.com/kripken/box2d.js/) for physics.
